# Display Array Clock Firmware

The latest firmware includes the addition of 4 timezones with different clock themes with the corresponding country Flag, the firmware is based on the SNTP example provided by Expressif which allows you to configure and set your Wifiâ€™s SSID and password for automatic clock time according to the chosen timezones.

I am very new with the ESP32 so I have tried with MicroPython, CircuitPython, Arduino, and Espressif repository running in Visual Studio Code, and the easiest for me was this last one, so I took the SNTP example located at the protocols example folder. In Visual Studio Code is the Espressif plug-in which makes it very easy and fast to get started with the ESP32.

### Visual Studio Code - Esspresif Plugin

After installing and opening the example we just need to configure the example for the Wifi credentials.

And now is as easy as adding the SPI configurations for the displays.
