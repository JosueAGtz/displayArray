The purpose of this code is to easily control color OLED/LCD
displays with a rich set of functions. The code can be built as
both an Arduino and Linux library. For Arduino, there are a wide variety
of target platforms and some don't have enough RAM to support every feature.
Specifically, AVR (Uno/Nano/Mega) don't have enough RAM to have
a back buffer. Without the back buffer, only text, pixel, rectangle and line drawing
are possible. With a back buffer, a host of other functions become available
such as ellipses, translucent/transparent rotating bitmaps, and transparent text.<br>

Features:<br>
---------<br>
- Supports the most popular display controllers (SSD1351, ST7735, ST7789, ILI9225, ILI9341, ILI9342, HX8357, ILI9468)<br>
- 5 built in font sizes (6x8, 8x8, 12x16, 16x16, 16x32)
- Supports display modes: 0/90/180/270 degree rotated, inverted, BGR or RGB color order<br>
- Direct display drawing, backbuffer (RAM) drawing or both simultaneously<br>
- Display object structure (SPILCD) allows multiple simultaenous displays of different types to be controlled by a single MCU<br>
- Bit Bang option allows controlling SPI displays on any GPIO pins<br>
- Communication callback functions allows controlling parallel and custom connected displays<br>
- DMA on SAMD21, SAMD51 and ESP32 targets<br>
- Compiles on Arduino and Linux (e.g. Raspberry Pi)
- Optimized primitives for text, lines, rectangles, ellipses and bitmap drawing<br>
- Fast (50x) drawing of Adafruit format custom fonts with optional blanking mode to erase old data without flickering<br>
- Load and display 4, 8 and 16-bit Windows BMP files (including RLE)<br>
- Deferred rendering allows quickly preparing a back buffer, then displaying it<br>
- Callbacks allow working with non-SPI displays (e.g. 8/16-bit parallel)<br>
