bb_spi_lcd Linux instructions
-----------------------------
For Linux, the bb_spi_lcd library gets built as a static C library.

Compile the library by running make from the command line. The include file and binary will be copied to the directories where they can be accessed by all.

Next, compile and run the sample program like so:
>make -f make_sample
>sudo ./sample

This will initialize the display and draw some blue text. Press ENTER to exit.

To display images/animations on your TFT hat, build the hatpic sample program:
>make -f make_hatpic
>sudo ./hatpic <image file>
