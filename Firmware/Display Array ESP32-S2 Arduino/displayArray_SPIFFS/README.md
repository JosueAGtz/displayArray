![displayArray](https://savageelectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DisplayArray-Sideview.png)

This code uses the ESP32-S2 Stick internal flash memory for the APP(1MB) and SPIFFS(3MB) making posible just to copy paste your PNG theme files directly to the data folder in your Arduino project and uploaded directly using the SPIFFS Uploader for the ESP32-S2.
